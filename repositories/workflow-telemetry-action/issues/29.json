I was wondering if it is possible to also get a csv or some other file format with the raw data points, either as a separate gist or added within the repository, however would be easier, rather than just the graphs in the summary? Is there any existing feature to accomplish something along those lines and/or is there any possible prospect of adding it?\r\n(An ad-hoc way I thought about would be parsing the SVG file for the data points, but would be ideal to add a raw data file during the post action instead if possible)",
